## Overview
For this project, I chose the Harry Potter Village Flourish and Blotts Bookshop as my reference. I followed the tutorial instructions and achieved all the required functionalities.

## Sub-models
For Part 2 of the project, I created four models and added them as subnetworks in the HDA file. Each model has two different variants that I included in my building.

- **Door**: Adjustable height, width, and outer door frame add-on. Doors can only appear on the first floor.

- **Hanging Shop Sign**: Adjustable height, width, and number of signs. (Since my reference doesn't have a balcony, I spoke with Elyssa and received approval to use this hanging sign instead

- **Bay Window**: I imported this FBX model from [CGTrader](https://www.cgtrader.com/product/oak-window).

I then followed the tutorial instructions to achieve additional functionalities such as pillars, borders, and supports.

## Extra Credits
- I added procedural roof tiles that always stack on the top floor of the building. The size of the tiles is also adjustable based on the top floor dimensions.
